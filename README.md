## 1. Introduction
The "Personal Protective Equipment Detection using YOLOv8" project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system to detect the presence of personal protective equipment (PPE) on individuals in various settings, such as construction sites, hospitals, or manufacturing facilities. The system utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model, leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques to automatically identify whether a person is wearing appropriate PPE, including items like helmets, masks, and safety vests.

## 2. Prerequisites
Before using the application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- Python 3.6+
- Flask
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 3. Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```https://github.com/KaedKazuha/Personal-Protective-Equipment-Detection-Yolov8/```


2. Change into the project directory:
```
cd your-repo
```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## 4. Usage
Provide detailed instructions on how to use the application. Include examples of how to run the PPE detection on sample images or videos using the Flask app.

## 5. Model Architecture (YOLOv8)
Explain the YOLOv8 architecture used for PPE detection. Include information about the backbone network, detection head, and anchor boxes used in the model.

## 6. Dataset
Describe the dataset used to train and evaluate the YOLOv8 PPE detection model. Include the source of the dataset, the number of samples, and the categories of PPE annotated in the dataset.

## 7. Training
Provide instructions on how to train the YOLOv8 PPE detection model using the dataset. Include details about hyperparameters, data augmentation techniques, and any specific settings.

## 8. Evaluation
Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the YOLOv8 PPE detection model. Describe how the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics were measured.

## 9. Results
Present the results obtained after training the YOLOv8 model and evaluating its performance. Include visualizations and tables showcasing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics.

## 10. Deployment with Flask
Explain the steps to deploy the PPE detection model using Flask. Provide instructions on how to run the Flask app and perform real-time PPE detection.

## 11. Future Improvements
Discuss potential future improvements for the project. This could include ideas for enhancing the model's accuracy, improving the user interface, or optimizing the deployment for better performance.
